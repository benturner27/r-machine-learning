# Machine Learning with R

This repository is studying and work done with the book "Machine Learning with R" by Brett Lantz. Each directory correlates with the chapter in the book. This is to show my progress and expanding my understanding in the machine learning discipline. Each directory will include an R script, csv files used for the exercises as well as images showing results and data visualisation.

## List of Contents

### Data Structures

This directory is associated with Chapter 2 in the book, which focuses on basic data structures within R, such as vectors and factors, data frames, matrices and arrays, as well as basic statistical calls and reading & writing from csv files.

### Nearest Neighbours

This directory is associated with Chapter 3 in the book, which focuses on using a Nearest Neighbour model. It also implements basic data processing, numerical data standardisation and cross-tabulation for model evaluation.
